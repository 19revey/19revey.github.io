### Why do we study particle segregation

After water, granular media are the most ubiquitous precursor material used in industry with an estimated annual consumption exceeding 1 trillion kg.

Segregation, or "demixing," of granular materials differing in size, density, or other particle properties is problematic in many circumstances
with broad implications in situations ranging from material handling in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and processes industries to natural
phenomena such as debris flow and sediment transport.
