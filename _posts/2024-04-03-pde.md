A general 2nd order linear PDE in two variables is written
$$Au_{xx}+2Bu_{xy}+C u_{yy}+ Du_x +Eu_y +F=0$$
and A,B,C,D,E,F can be functions depending on x and y. We say a PDE is elliptic, hyperbolic or parabolic if 

|$$B^2-AC=0$$| parabolic |  Burger's equation $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\nu \Delta^2 u$$| require both initial and boundary condition| solutions to elliptic PDEs are smooth and have no singularities|
|$$B^2-AC>0$$| hyperbolic |  wave equation $$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}=c^2 \Delta^2 u$$| require both initial and boundary condition| solutions to hyperbolic PDEs involve wave propagation and can exhibit phenomena such as shocks and discontinuities|
|$$B^2-AC<0$$| elliptic |  laplace's equation $$\Delta^2 u=0$$| no time dependence, steady state| solutions to parabolic PDEs evolve smoothly in time and space, typically leading to stable solutions|

<h2 style="color:purple;font-size: 2em;">Boundary condition type</h2>

- Dirichlet Boundary Condition : $$u(x, t) = g(x, t)$$ 
- Neumann Boundary Condition : $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = h(x, t)$$
