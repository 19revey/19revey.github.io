# PyTorch Tensor Manipulation Methods

This document summarizes commonly used PyTorch tensor manipulation functions, their purposes, and examples.

## 1. `squeeze`

**Function**: Removes dimensions of size 1 from a tensor.

**Example**:
```python
tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 4, 1)
tensor_squeezed = tensor.squeeze()  # Removes all dimensions of size 1, resulting shape: (3, 4)
tensor_squeezed_dim = tensor.squeeze(0)  # Removes size 1 from the 0th dimension, resulting shape: (3, 4, 1)
```

## 2. `view`

**Function**: Reshapes a tensor without changing its data storage order.

**Example**:
```python
tensor = torch.randn(4, 4)
tensor_reshaped = tensor.view(2, 8)  # Reshapes to shape: (2, 8)
```

## 3. `reshape`

**Function**: Similar to `view`, reshapes a tensor, but may create a copy of the data if necessary.

**Example**:
```python
tensor = torch.randn(4, 4)
tensor_reshaped = tensor.reshape(2, 8)  # Reshapes to shape: (2, 8)
```

## 4. `permute`

**Function**: Reorders the dimensions of a tensor.

**Example**:
```python
tensor = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)
tensor_permuted = tensor.permute(2, 0, 1)  # Changes dimension order, resulting shape: (4, 2, 3)
```

## 5. `transpose`

**Function**: Swaps two specified dimensions of a tensor.

**Example**:
```python
tensor = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)
tensor_transposed = tensor.transpose(1, 2)  # Swaps the 1st and 2nd dimensions, resulting shape: (2, 4, 3)
```

## 6. `expand` and `expand_as`

**Function**: Expands a tensor to match a specified shape without copying data, useful for broadcasting.

**Example**:
```python
tensor = torch.randn(1, 3)
tensor_expanded = tensor.expand(4, 3)  # Expands to shape: (4, 3)
```

## 7. `repeat`

**Function**: Duplicates tensor data and repeats it along specified dimensions.

**Example**:
```python
tensor = torch.randn(2, 2)
tensor_repeated = tensor.repeat(2, 3)  # Results in shape: (4, 6)
```

## 8. `flatten`

**Function**: Flattens a tensor into one dimension.

**Example**:
```python
tensor = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)
tensor_flattened = tensor.flatten()  # Results in shape: (24,)
```

These tensor manipulation methods help reshape, reorder, and expand tensors efficiently to fit different computational needs and network architectures.
